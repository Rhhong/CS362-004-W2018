Bugs in teammates code:

1) Bug in the smithy_card function:
	Smithy card draws 4 cards instead of 3.

	for (i = 0; i < 4; i++)
     {
       drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
     }

	In the for loop, the loop should run 3 times instead of 4.

2) Bug in the council_room_card function:
	Council_room card draws 3 cards instead of 4 for the 	player.

	//+4 Cards
   	for (i = 1; i < 4; i++)
     {
       drawCard(currentPlayer, state);
     }

	In the for loop, the range should be from i = 0 to i < 4.
